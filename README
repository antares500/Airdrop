==Meet Airdrop==
Airdrop is an automatic WordPress deployment script. Put it where you want WordPress installed, and open it in your browser.

On top of being much faster, Airdrop also downloads your WordPress themes and installs plugins automatically. It is by far the most convenient way to install WordPress on a shared host.
